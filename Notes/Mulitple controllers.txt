A view can have multiple controllers attached to it which specifically work on that part of the view to which the controller has been
attached.Each controller is separate form the other and has it's own scope object.Lets see this below:

HTML:

 <div id="container">
        //controller 1
          <div ng-controller="myController">
                
               <h1>{{ name}} </h1>
             
                
          </div>
         //controller 2
          <div ng-controller="secondController">
                
               <h3>{{ name}} </h3>
             
                
          </div>
                
         </div>
         
    </div>




SCRIPT:

var myApp=angular.module("myConnector",[]);
//this controller has its own version of the $scope object
myApp.controller("myController",["$scope","$filter",function($scope,$filter){

                
   $scope.name="akash";
    

}]);

//this has its own version so name here is the property of its own scope object and has nothing to do with the name property above.
myApp.controller("secondController",["$scope",function($scope){

    $scope.name="gupta";
}]);
