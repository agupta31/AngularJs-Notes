Angular js-

what is the problem that it is trying to solve?

suppose we want to display something on the page by clicking a button.In a general scenario
we write code in JS or jquery to attach a click event to the button and then so some
call back work when it is clicked by getting the element tag and displaying data inside it
using the inner html property of that element.Imagine if we had hunderds of buttons like 
that it would result in thousands of lines of code.We use angular js to avoid this problem.
Angular js uses the concept of model and view where the model is bound to the view and any
changes in the model will dynamically reflect on the view.Here the view is your html page.
