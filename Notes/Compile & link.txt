COMPILE AND LINK:In comp science when building code a compiler converts the code into a lower level machine readable language.
The linker then generates a file which interacts with your computer will actually interact with.

In angular js this is not exactly what they mean.

We do compile in angular js to change a part of the html before it is outputed on the page.

post-link: we use link to grab a piece of a current instance of the directive ,check the scope and do some action before it is outputted
to the page. 
pre link-this parses the directives from top to bottom
post link-this parses the directives from bottom up-this is safer.




HOW AND WHERE TO USE THEM:

.JS:
myApp.controller("myController",function($scope,$log){
    
      $scope.people=[
          {
          
              name:"akash",
              schoolName:"xavier's",
              company:"infosys",
              age:26
              
          },
    
         {
          
              name:"utpal",
              schoolName:"james",
              company:"TCS",
              age:23
              
          },
         {
          
              name:"shraboni",
              schoolName:"la mart",
              company:"cognizant",
              age:26
              
          }
    ]
    
    
    $scope.getAddress=function(person){
          return person.schoolName +" "+person.company+" "+person.age;
    }
    
    
    })
  
     


myApp.controller("secondController",function($scope,$log){
   
        $scope.people={
                   name:"badhrel",
                   address:"bagnan in howrah ",
                   city:"kolkata",
                  state:"west bengal",
                  zip:28262
                  
        };
    
           $scope.getAddress=function(person){
            return person.city+" "+person.state+" "+person.zip;
       }
   
    })


myApp.directive("searchResult",function(){
      return {
          templateUrl:"C:/Users/akash/Desktop/ang/searchRes.htm",
          replace:'true',
          scope:{
               personObject:"=",
               personAddress:"&"
              
          } ,
          compile:function(elem,attr){
          
              console.log("compiling..");
            //removing the attribute class from the view associated with this directive
              elem.removeAttr("class");
              console.log(elem.html());
          
          //we have to understand that every time we are running ng-repeat there is create a different instance of this directive
   // with its own scope so we can use post linking to grab a piece of code fom the model or the view attached with that current instance
   //of the directive and change it on the fly before the view is rendered on the page.
               return{
              //scope here is the isolate scope,elements is the view   
                   post:function(scope,elements,attrs){
                             console.log("post linking...");
                              if(scope.personObject.name==="akash")
                                  elements.removeAttr("class");
           
                                   }
          
                 }
      }
    
            
      }
    
});



searchRes.htm:

 <a href="#" class="list-group-item active">
     <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">{{personObject.name}}</h4>
     <p class="list-group-item-text"> 
         
         {{personAddress({aperson:personObject})}} 
     
     </p>
</a>



SHORTHAND NOTATION FOR LINK:
 
link:function(scope,elements,attrs){
                             console.log("post linking...");
                              if(scope.personObject.name==="akash")
                                  elements.removeAttr("class");
           
                                   }
