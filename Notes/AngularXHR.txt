INCEPTION OF SPA'S-it is based ont he concept of XHR(xml http request) which allows you fetch data from the server
without the need to refresh the page.
SPA gives a desktop type of feel with the browser.
gmail is a perfect example of a SPA.When you change the view under the inbox tabs the page does not refresh and renders
the view on the page.Similarly when you compose a mail and send it the browser does not refesh.All this is done by
XHR.

FEATURES OF SPA:
HTTP communication using XHR--->you can write your own XHR in JS but it is verbose and takes up lots of code.
DOM manipulation becomes easy
State and routing

Load the page once and download all contents.Then provide access to different parts of the contents using routing
with desired parts of the content kept in local files.

As the diagram above shows in a SPA.We load the main page only once and then we  load different
views on that page on the fly.Routing takes us to a particular view which is displayed on the main page
and XHR is used to load any data required by this view from the server.
