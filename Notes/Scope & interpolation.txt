INTERPOLATION: creating a string by combining strings and placeholders.
for eg:  "my name is"+name will create a new string my name is Akash where 'name' is a placeholder.

<body>
        
     <div id="container">
          //as soon as angular sees that this part is attached to the controller it runs it's code inside this.
          <div ng-controller="myController">
              //angular sees the property name inside the brackets and knows that it belong to the scope object.
             //html downloads this code as it is here.However,when angular sees this piece of html it runs its own
            //code and saves the changed code in the browsers memory.So the browser display's the new code.
             <h1>My name is {{name+" i am great"}}</h1>
         </div>

    </div>
    

 <script type="text/javascript" src="https://code.angularjs.org/1.5.0-rc.2/angular.js"></script>

        <script type="text/javascript" src="angScript.js"></script>
    
</body>



SCRIPT:
var myApp=angular.module("myConnector",[]);

myApp.controller("myController",["$scope",function($scope){
    //storing a property called name inside the $scope object.
   $scope.name="akash";
}])


//another EXAMPLE:
var myApp=angular.module("myConnector",[]);

myApp.controller("myController",["$scope","$timeout",function($scope,$setTimeout){
    
   $scope.name="akash";


   $setTimeout(function() {

   	$scope.name="nadhrel";
   },3000);
}])

OUTPUT:

//after 3 secs
my name is nadhrel i am great
