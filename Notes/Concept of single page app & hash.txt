CONCEPT OF SINGLE PAGE APPS AND HASH:

Let us see what hash is used for:
HTML:
<body>
<a href="#bookmark">Go to Bookmark</a>


<p><a id="bookmark"><strong>This is a bookmark</strong></a>McMahon gained significant traction when 
he hired AWA talent Hulk Hogan, who had achieved popularity 
outside of wrestling, notably for his appearance in the film Rocky III.[22] 
McMahon signed Roddy Piper as Hogan's rival, and then shortly afterward Jesse Ventura as an announcer. 
Other wrestlers joined the roster, such as Jimmy Snuka, Don Muraco, 
The Iron Sheik, Nikolai Volkoff, Junkyard Dog, Paul Orndorff, Greg Valentine and Ricky Steamboat.
 Many of the wrestlers who would join later were former AWA or NWA talent.

We are defining an anchor tag with an id bookmark and we are giving its link at the top(<a href="#bookmark">Go to Bookmark</a>).
So when the user clicks on this link it takes him to that bookmark.We can use this concept to design SPA's.How ?


We can physically check the value of this bookmark using javascript event handlers:

SCRIPT:
window.addEventListener('hashchange',function(){
   //gives the value of the hash at that location
   console.log("hash changed:" + window.location.hash);
});

Whenever we change the value of the hash in the url of the page it logs the changed value.So this hash value is nothing but a string 
and we can do anything with it.for eg:
we can do this:
file:///C:/Users/akash/Desktop/angularJs/index.htm#/bookmark/1
file:///C:/Users/akash/Desktop/angularJs/index.htm#/bookmark/2
file:///C:/Users/akash/Desktop/angularJs/index.htm#/bookmark/3

and then we can use the value of these hash to write logic for them individually.Lets see how that works:

.JS:

window.addEventListener('hashchange',function(){
   
   if(window.location.hash==="#/bookmark/1")
    console.log("this is bookmark 1");

   if(window.location.hash==="#/bookmark/2")
    console.log("this is bookmark 2");

   if(window.location.hash==="#/bookmark/3")
      console.log("this is bookmark 3");
});
 

Angular incorporates this logic when designing SPA's.The browser makes a single HTTP request for the whole page and based on the
values provided in the hashchange function it runs some logic.

In short angular js has the utility to grab whatever is in the hash!!This is achieved by its built in object $location.path() which
gives the value of the hash.

url-file:///C:/Users/akash/Desktop/angularJs/index.htm#/dhdld
file:///C:/Users/akash/Desktop/angularJs/index.htm#hahah


.JS:
var myApp=angular.module("myConnector",[]);

myApp.controller("myController",["$scope","$filter","$location",
  function($scope,$filter,$location){
//angular object location has a method called path which stores the value of the hash.
   console.log($location.path());
                
    }]);

OUTPUT:
/dhdld
hahah
