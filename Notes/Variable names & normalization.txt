NORMALIZATION:to make consistent to a standard.In layman terms we have a variety of things and we change all of them to make them 
consistent to the same standard.

eg:
HTML:
<search-result result-link-ref="#"></search-result>

here <search-result></search-result> is a custom directive
.JS:
we cannot access the attribute result-link-ref inside JS like this:

var result-link-ref="#"
:you will get an error because - in js is minus.

So what angular JS does is that it converts the above attribute to a set standard(normalizes it) to what is known as Camel casing.
As a result of this we can use var resultLinkRef="#" in our script file and it won't throw an error.
